---

## Tools/Programs Used:
- **Microsoft Azure**: Used to create and manage the virtual machines where the Active Directory and PowerShell scripts are executed.
- **Windows Server 2022**: The operating system running on both the domain controller and client machines.
- **Remote Desktop Connection**: Utilized to access and manage the virtual machines.
- **PowerShell ISE**: Used to write, edit, and execute PowerShell scripts for automating Active Directory tasks.
- **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**: Interface to verify and manage user accounts created via automation.
- **PowerShell**: Script execution environment used for creating and managing Active Directory users.

---

## Skills Demonstrated:
- **Virtual Machine Management in Azure**: Set up and managed virtual machines in Microsoft Azure, including configuring the domain controller and client machines.
- **Remote Desktop Access**: Connected to the virtual machines through Remote Desktop to execute administrative tasks.
- **Scripting in PowerShell**: Automated the creation of Active Directory users using PowerShell scripts.
- **Automating Bulk User Creation**: Scripted the generation and configuration of 1,000 users in Active Directory, showing proficiency in scaling administrative tasks.
- **Active Directory Management**: Verified the creation of user accounts in ADUC, confirming successful automation.
- **Network and User Environment Validation**: Tested user login functionality and ensured the proper environment setup for each created user.

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial where you will learn to automate the creation of user accounts in Active Directory using PowerShell. This method is efficient, reliable, and perfect for large-scale user management tasks.

## Step 1: Launch PowerShell ISE with Admin Rights

Start by opening the PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) as an administrator. This provides the necessary permissions to run scripts that interact with Active Directory.

## Step 2: Script Preparation

In the PowerShell ISE, draft or open your pre-written script designed for mass user account creation. Before running, ensure the script logic is correct to prevent any accidental errors.

## Step 3: Execute the Creation Script

With your script loaded in the ISE, initiate the execution process. Observe the output carefully for successful execution or to catch and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
(Script below automates 1000 user accounts, simply change the number in the second line of the script to suit your needs.)
```powershell
$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS = "123456789Abc!"
$NUMBER_OF_ACCOUNTS_TO_CREATE = 1000
# ------------------------------------------------------ #

Function generate-random-name() {
    $consonants = @('b','c','d','f','g','h','j','k','l','m','n','p','q','r','s','t','v','w','x','z')
    $vowels = @('a','e','i','o','u','y')
    $nameLength = Get-Random -Minimum 3 -Maximum 7
    $count = 0
    $name = ""
    
    while ($count -lt $nameLength) {
        if ($($count % 2) -eq 0) {
            $name += $consonants[$(Get-Random -Minimum 0 -Maximum $($consonants.Count - 1))]
        } else {
            $name += $vowels[$(Get-Random -Minimum 0 -Maximum $($vowels.Count - 1))]
        }
        $count++
    }
    
    return $name
}

$count = 1
while ($count -lt $NUMBER_OF_ACCOUNTS_TO_CREATE) {
    $firstName = generate-random-name
    $lastName = generate-random-name
    $username = $firstName + '.' + $lastName
    $password = ConvertTo-SecureString $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS -AsPlainText -Force

    Write-Host "Creating user: $($username)" -BackgroundColor Black -ForegroundColor Cyan
    
    New-AdUser -AccountPassword $password `
               -GivenName $firstName `
               -Surname $lastName `
               -DisplayName $username `
               -Name $username `
               -EmployeeID $username `
               -PasswordNeverExpires $true `
               -Path "ou=_EMPLOYEES,$(([ADSI]``"").distinguishedName)" `
               -Enabled $true
    
    $count++
}

```

## Step 4: Confirm User Accounts Creation

Once the script completes, verify in the Active Directory that all user accounts have been created and choose a random account to log into. This step not only confirms the script's effectiveness but also demonstrates the login process.

## Step 5: Log into the Newly Created Account

Demonstrate the process of logging into the newly created user account ('fur.wax') to ensure that user can log in successfully.

![Logging into Account](https://github.com/KLavallais/KLavallais/blob/assets/AutomatedRandomUsers_05.png?raw=true)

Confirm the active session by logging into the Virtual Machine as the new user and verify that the correct user profile is loaded and operational.

## Step 6: Execute Commands as the New User

Once logged in as 'fur.wax', verify you can perform tasks like pinging other systems or running commands that indicate the user environment is correctly set up.

## Step 7: Final Verification and Configuration

Perform a final check to confirm that all user settings are correctly configured, which might involve pinging network resources or accessing shared drives to ensure network connectivity and proper permissions are in place.

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial, youâ€™ve efficiently created multiple user accounts using PowerShell automation. This process, combined with the setup of virtual machines in **Microsoft Azure**, not only saves time but also introduces a high level of accuracy and consistency in administrative tasks. 

[This post](https://github.com/KLavallais/InstallAD) expands on the skills you've just seen demonstrated here. You will see how I manage folder permissions, security groups, and user account creation on virtual machines in Azure. If you're interested in a broader view of **permissions management** and **group policies**, head over to this **Active Directory** [video walkthrough](https://github.com/KLavallais/AzureADVideo). Together, these resources provide a comprehensive look at how I use **Azure**, **Active Directory**, and **PowerShell** to streamline IT management tasks.
